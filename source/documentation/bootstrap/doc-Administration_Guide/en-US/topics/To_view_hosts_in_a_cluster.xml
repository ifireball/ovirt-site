	<title>Managing System Permissions for a Host</title>
	<para>
		As the <guilabel>SuperUser</guilabel>, the system administrator manages all aspects of the Administration Portal. More specific administrative roles can be assigned to other users. These restricted administrator roles are useful for granting a user administrative privileges that limit them to a specific resource. For example, a <guilabel>DataCenterAdmin</guilabel> role has administrator privileges only for the assigned data center with the exception of the storage for that data center, and a <guilabel>ClusterAdmin</guilabel> has administrator privileges only for the assigned cluster.
	</para>
	<para>
		A host administrator is a system administration role for a specific host only. This is useful in clusters with multiple hosts, where each host requires a system administrator. You can use the <guilabel>Configure</guilabel> button in the header bar to assign a host administrator for all hosts in the environment.

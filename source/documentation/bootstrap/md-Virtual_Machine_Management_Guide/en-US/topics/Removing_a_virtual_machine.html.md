# Removing a Virtual Machine

**Important:** The **Remove** button is disabled while virtual machines are running; you must shut down a virtual machine before you can remove it.

**Removing Virtual Machines**

1. Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select the virtual machine to remove.

2. Click **Remove**.

3. Optionally, select the **Remove Disk(s)** check box to remove the virtual disks attached to the virtual machine together with the virtual machine. If the **Remove Disk(s)** check box is cleared, then the virtual disks remain in the environment as floating disks.

4. Click **OK**.

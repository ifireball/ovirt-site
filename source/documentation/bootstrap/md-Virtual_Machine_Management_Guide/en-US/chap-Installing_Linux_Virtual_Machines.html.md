# Installing Linux Virtual Machines

This chapter describes the steps required to install a Linux virtual machine:

1. Create a blank virtual machine on which to install an operating system.

2. Add a virtual disk for storage.

3. Add a network interface to connect the virtual machine to the network.

4. Install an operating system on the virtual machine. See your operating system's documentation for instructions.

5. Register the virtual machine with the Content Delivery Network and subscribe to the relevant entitlements.

6. Install guest agents and drivers for additional virtual machine functionality.

When all of these steps are complete, the new virtual machine is functional and ready to perform tasks.

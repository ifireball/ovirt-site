	<title>Read Only Disks in Red Hat Virtualization</title>
	<para>
		Some applications require administrators to share data with read-only rights. You can do this when creating or editing a disk attached to a virtual machine via the <guibutton>Disks</guibutton> tab in the details pane of the virtual machine and selecting the <guilabel>Read Only</guilabel> check box. That way, a single disk can be read by multiple cluster-aware guests, while an administrator maintains writing privileges.
	</para>
	<para>
		You cannot change the read-only status of a disk while the virtual machine is running.
	</para>
	<important>
		<para>
			Mounting a journaled file system requires read-write access. Using the <guilabel>Read Only</guilabel> option is not appropriate for virtual machine disks that contain such file systems (e.g. <systemitem class="filesystem">EXT3</systemitem>, <systemitem class="filesystem">EXT4</systemitem>, or <systemitem class="filesystem">XFS</systemitem>).

# Logging out of a Virtual Machine

To minimize the risk of data loss log out from a virtual machine before shutting it down. Additionally, if you attempt to forcefully shut down a virtual machine from the User Portal, it might freeze with a status of **Powering Down**.

**Shutting down a virtual machine**

1. Log out of the guest operating system.

2. If you were using your virtual machine in full screen mode, press **Shift** + **F11** to exit full screen mode, and close the virtual machine's console window. You are now returned to the User Portal.

3. To shut down the virtual machine, click the ![](images/4647.png) button. The virtual machine is grayed out and displays as "Machine is Down" when it has been turned off.

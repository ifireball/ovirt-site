	<title>Updating the MoM Policy on Hosts in a Cluster</title>
	<para>
		The Memory Overcommit Manager handles memory balloon and KSM functions on a host. Changes to these functions at the cluster level are only passed to hosts the next time a host moves to a status of <guilabel>Up</guilabel> after being rebooted or in maintenance mode. However, if necessary you can apply important changes to a host immediately by synchronizing the MoM policy while the host is <guilabel>Up</guilabel>. The following procedure must be performed on each host individually.

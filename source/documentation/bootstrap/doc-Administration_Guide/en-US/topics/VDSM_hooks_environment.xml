	<title>The VDSM Hook Environment</title>
	<para>
		Most hook scripts are run as the <systemitem class="username">vdsm</systemitem> user and inherit the environment of the VDSM process. The exceptions are hook scripts triggered by the <systemitem>before_vdsm_start</systemitem> and <systemitem>after_vdsm_stop</systemitem> events. Hook scripts triggered by these events run as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user and do not inherit the environment of the VDSM process.

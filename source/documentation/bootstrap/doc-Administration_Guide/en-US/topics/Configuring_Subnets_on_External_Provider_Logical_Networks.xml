	<title>Configuring Subnets on External Provider Logical Networks</title>
	<para>
		A logical network provided by an external provider can only assign <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses to virtual machines if one or more subnets have been defined on that logical network. If no subnets are defined, virtual machines will not be assigned <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses. If there is one subnet, virtual machines will be assigned an IP address from that subnet, and if there are multiple subnets, virtual machines will be assigned an <acronym>IP</acronym> address from any of the available subnets. The <acronym>DHCP</acronym> service provided by the external network provider on which the logical network is hosted is responsible for assigning these <acronym>IP</acronym> addresses.
	</para>
	<para>
		While the Red Hat Virtualization Manager automatically discovers predefined subnets on imported logical networks, you can also add or remove subnets to or from logical networks from within the Manager.

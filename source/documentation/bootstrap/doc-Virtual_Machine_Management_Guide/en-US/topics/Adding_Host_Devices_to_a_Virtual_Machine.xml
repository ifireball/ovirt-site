			<para>
				Select a virtual machine and click the <guilabel>Host Devices</guilabel> tab in the details pane to list the host devices already attached to this virtual machine. A virtual machine can only have devices attached from the same host. If a virtual machine has attached devices from one host, and you attach a device from another host, the attached devices from the previous host will be automatically removed.
			</para>
			<para>
				Attaching host devices to a virtual machine requires the virtual machine to be in a <literal>Down</literal> state. If the virtual machine is running, the changes will not take effect until after the virtual machine has been shut down.

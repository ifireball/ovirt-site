	<title>Memory Requirements</title>
	<para>
		The amount of <acronym>RAM</acronym> required varies depending on guest operating system requirements, guest application requirements, and memory activity and usage of guests. You also need to take into account that <acronym>KVM</acronym> is able to overcommit physical <acronym>RAM</acronym> for virtualized guests. This allows for provisioning of guests with <acronym>RAM</acronym> requirements greater than what is physically present, on the basis that the guests are not all concurrently at peak load. <acronym>KVM</acronym> does this by only allocating <acronym>RAM</acronym> for guests as required and shifting underutilized guests into swap.

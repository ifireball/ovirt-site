		Red Hat Virtualization supports two types of hosts: Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux host. Depending on your environment requirement, you may want to use one type only or both in your Red Hat Virtualization environment. It is recommended that you install and attach at least two hosts to the Red Hat Virtualization environment. Where you attach only one host you will be unable to access features such as migration and high availability.

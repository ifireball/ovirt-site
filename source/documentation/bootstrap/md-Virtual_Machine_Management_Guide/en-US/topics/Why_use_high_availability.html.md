# Why Use High Availability?

High availability is recommended for virtual machines running critical workloads.

High availability can ensure that virtual machines are restarted in the following scenarios:

* When a host becomes non-operational due to hardware failure.

* When a host is put into maintenance mode for scheduled downtime.

* When a host becomes unavailable because it has lost communication with an external storage resource.

A high availability virtual machine is automatically restarted, either on its original host or another host in the cluster.

		Red Hat Virtualization provides a range of pre-configured roles, from an administrator with system-wide permissions to an end user with access to a single virtual machine.

				Administrator Role: Allows access to the <emphasis>Administration Portal</emphasis> for managing physical and virtual resources. An administrator role confers permissions for actions to be performed in the User Portal; however, it has no bearing on what a user can see in the User Portal.

				User Role: Allows access to the <emphasis>User Portal</emphasis> for managing and accessing virtual machines and templates. A user role determines what a user can see in the User Portal. Permissions granted to a user with an administrator role are reflected in the actions available to that user in the User Portal.

		For example, if you have an <literal>administrator</literal> role on a cluster, you can manage all virtual machines in the cluster using the <emphasis>Administration Portal</emphasis>. However, you cannot access any of these virtual machines in the <emphasis>User Portal</emphasis>; this requires a <literal>user</literal> role.

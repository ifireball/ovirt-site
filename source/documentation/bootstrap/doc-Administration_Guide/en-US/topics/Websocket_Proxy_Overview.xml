	<title>Websocket Proxy Overview</title>
	<para>
		The websocket proxy allows users to connect to virtual machines via noVNC and SPICE HTML5 consoles. Previously, the websocket proxy could only run on the Red Hat Virtualization Manager machine, but now the proxy can run on any machine that has access to the network.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	   The websocket proxy can be installed and configured on the Red Hat Virtualization Manager machine during the initial configuration (see <ulink url="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/single/installation-guide/#Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_Manager_Configuration_Overview">Configuring the Red Hat Virtualization Manager</ulink> in the <citetitle>Installation Guide</citetitle>), or on a separate machine (see <ulink url="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/single/installation-guide/#appe-Installing_the_Websocket_Proxy_on_a_different_host">Installing a Websocket Proxy on a Separate Machine</ulink> in the <citetitle>Installation Guide</citetitle>).
   </para>
   <para>
       The websocket proxy can also be migrated from the Manager machine to a separate machine. See <xref linkend="Migrating_the_Websocket_Proxy_to_a_Separate_Host"/>.

       <para>
           SPICE HTML5 support is a Technology Preview feature. Technology Preview features are not fully supported under Red Hat Subscription Service Level Agreements (SLAs), may not be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use. However, these features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

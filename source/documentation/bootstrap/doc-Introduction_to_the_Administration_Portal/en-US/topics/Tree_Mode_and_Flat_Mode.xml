	<title>Tree Mode and Flat Mode</title>
	<para>
		The Administration Portal provides two different modes for managing your resources: tree mode and flat mode. Tree mode displays resources in a hierarchical view per data center, from the highest level of the data center down to the individual virtual machine. <!--Tree mode provides a visual representation of the virtualization system.-->Working in tree mode is highly recommended for most operations.

	<para>
		Flat mode allows you to search across data centers, or storage domains. It does not limit you to viewing the resources of a single hierarchy. For example, flat mode makes it possible to find all virtual machines that are using more than 80% CPU across clusters and data centers, or locate all hosts that have the highest utilization. In addition, certain objects, such as <guilabel>Pools</guilabel> and <guilabel>Users</guilabel> are not in the data center hierarchy and can be accessed only in flat mode.
	</para>
	<para>
		To access flat mode, click on the <guilabel>System</guilabel> item in the <guilabel>Tree</guilabel> pane on the left side of the screen. You are in flat mode if the <guilabel>Pools</guilabel> and <guilabel>Users</guilabel> resource tabs appear.

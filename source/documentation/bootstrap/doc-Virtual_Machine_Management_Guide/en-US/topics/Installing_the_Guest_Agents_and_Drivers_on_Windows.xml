	<para>
		The Red Hat Virtualization guest agents and drivers are installed on Windows virtual machines using the <filename>rhev-tools-setup.iso</filename> <acronym>ISO</acronym> file, which is provided by the <package>rhev-guest-tools-iso</package> package installed as a dependency to the Red Hat Virtualization Manager. This <acronym>ISO</acronym> file is located in <filename>/usr/share/rhev-guest-tools-iso/rhev-tools-setup.iso</filename> on the system on which the Red Hat Virtualization Manager is installed.
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>
			The <filename>rhev-tools-setup.iso</filename> <acronym>ISO</acronym> file is automatically copied to the default <acronym>ISO</acronym> storage domain, if any, when you run <command>engine-setup</command>, or must be manually uploaded to an <acronym>ISO</acronym> storage domain.

			Updated versions of the <filename>rhev-tools-setup.iso</filename> <acronym>ISO</acronym> file must be manually attached to running Windows virtual machines to install updated versions of the tools and drivers. If the <acronym>APT</acronym> service is enabled on virtual machines, the updated <acronym>ISO</acronym> files will be automatically attached.

			If you install the guest agents and drivers from the command line or as part of a deployment tool such as Windows Deployment Services, you can append the options <literal>ISSILENTMODE</literal> and <literal>ISNOREBOOT</literal> to <literal>RHEV-toolsSetup.exe</literal> to silently install the guest agents and drivers and prevent the machine on which they have been installed from rebooting immediately after installation. The machine can then be rebooted later once the deployment process is complete.

		The guest agents and drivers now pass usage information to the Red Hat Virtualization Manager and allow you to access USB devices, single sign-on into virtual machines and other functionality. The Red Hat Virtualization guest agent runs as a service called <systemitem>RHEV Agent</systemitem> that you can configure using the <filename>rhev-agent</filename> configuration file located in <filename>C:\Program Files\Redhat\RHEV\Drivers\Agent</filename>.

	<title>Creating a Cloned Virtual Machine Based on a Template</title>
	<para>
		Cloned virtual machines are similar to virtual machines based on templates. However, while a cloned virtual machine inherits settings in the same way as a virtual machine based on a template, a cloned virtual machine does not depend on the template on which it was based after it has been created.
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>
			If you clone a virtual machine from a template, the name of the template on which that virtual machine was based is displayed in the <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab of the <guilabel>Edit Virtual Machine</guilabel> window for that virtual machine. If you change the name of that template, the name of the template in the <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab will also be updated. However, if you delete the template from the Manager, the original name of that template will be displayed instead.

		<title>Cloning a Virtual Machine Based on a Template</title>
		<step>
			<para>
				Click the <guilabel>Virtual Machines</guilabel> tab.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Click <guibutton>New VM</guibutton>.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Select the <guilabel>Cluster</guilabel> on which the virtual machine will run.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Select a template from the <guilabel>Based on Template</guilabel> drop-down menu.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Enter a <guilabel>Name</guilabel>, <guilabel>Description</guilabel> and any <guilabel>Comments</guilabel>. You can accept the default values inherited from the template in the rest of the fields, or change them if required.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Click the <guilabel>Resource Allocation</guilabel> tab.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Select the <guilabel>Clone</guilabel> radio button in the <guilabel>Storage Allocation</guilabel> area.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Select the disk provisioning policy from the <guilabel>Allocation Policy</guilabel> drop-down menu. This policy affects the speed of the clone operation and the amount of disk space the new virtual machine initially requires.
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Selecting <guilabel>Thin Provision</guilabel> results in a faster clone operation and provides optimized usage of storage capacity. Disk space is allocated only as it is required. This is the default selection.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Selecting <guilabel>Preallocated</guilabel> results in a slower clone operation and provides optimized virtual machine read and write operations. All disk space requested in the template is allocated at the time of the clone operation.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Use the <guilabel>Target</guilabel> drop-down menu to select the storage domain on which the virtual machine's virtual disk will be stored.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.
			</para>
		</step>
	</procedure>
	<note>
		<para>
			Cloning a virtual machine may take some time. A new copy of the template's disk must be created. During this time, the virtual machine's status is first <guilabel>Image Locked</guilabel>, then <guilabel>Down</guilabel>.
		</para>
	</note>
	<para>
		The virtual machine is created and displayed in the <guilabel>Virtual Machines</guilabel> tab. You can now assign users to it, and can begin using it when the clone operation is complete.

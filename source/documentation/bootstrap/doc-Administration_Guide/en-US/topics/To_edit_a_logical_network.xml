		<para>
			Multi-host network configuration automatically applies updated network settings to all of the hosts within the data center to which the network is assigned. Changes can only be applied when virtual machines using the network are down. You cannot rename a logical network that is already configured on a host. You cannot disable the <guilabel>VM Network</guilabel> option while virtual machines or templates using that network are running.

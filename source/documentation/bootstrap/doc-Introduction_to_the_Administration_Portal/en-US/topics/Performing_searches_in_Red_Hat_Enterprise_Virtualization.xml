	<title>Performing Searches in Red Hat Virtualization</title>
	<para>
		The Administration Portal enables the management of thousands of resources, such as virtual machines, hosts, users, and more. <!--When managing the Red Hat Virtualization environment, it is recommended that large lists of resources, such as virtual machines, are reduced to a manageable number (for example, 10). This allows tasks to be performed on the smaller list, or to select specific items on the list on which to perform a given task.--> To perform a search, enter the search query (free-text or syntax-based) into the search bar. Search queries can be saved as bookmarks for future reuse, so you do not have to reenter a search query each time the specific search results are required. Searches are not case sensitive.

# Cloning a Virtual Machine

You can clone virtual machines without having to create a template or a snapshot first.

**Important:** The **Clone VM** button is disabled while virtual machines are running; you must shut down a virtual machine before you can clone it.

**Cloning Virtual Machines**

1. Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select the virtual machine to clone.

2. Click **Clone VM**.

3. Enter a **Clone Name** for the new virtual machine.

4. Click **OK**.

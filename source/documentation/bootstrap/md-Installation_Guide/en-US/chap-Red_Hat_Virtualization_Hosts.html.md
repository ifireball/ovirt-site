# Red Hat Virtualization Hosts

Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 introduces an upgraded version of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. While the previous RHEV-H was a closed system with a basic text user interface for installation and configuration, Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) can be updated via `yum` and uses an Anaconda installation interface based on the one used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts.

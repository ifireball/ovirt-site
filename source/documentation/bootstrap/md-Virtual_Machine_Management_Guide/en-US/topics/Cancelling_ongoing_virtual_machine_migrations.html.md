# Canceling Ongoing Virtual Machine Migrations

A virtual machine migration is taking longer than you expected. You'd like to be sure where all virtual machines are running before you make any changes to your environment.

**Canceling Ongoing Virtual Machine Migrations**

1. Select the migrating virtual machine. It is displayed in the **Virtual Machines** resource tab with a status of **Migrating from**.

2. Click **Cancel Migration**.

The virtual machine status returns from **Migrating from** to **Up**.

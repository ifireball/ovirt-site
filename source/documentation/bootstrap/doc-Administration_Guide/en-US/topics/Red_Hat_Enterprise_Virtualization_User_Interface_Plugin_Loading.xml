	<title>Red Hat Virtualization User Interface Plug-in Loading</title>
	<para>
		After a plug-in has been discovered and its data is embedded into the administration portal HTML page, administration portal tries to load the plug-in as part of application startup (unless you have configured it not to load as part of application startup).
	</para>
	<para>
		For each plug-in that has been discovered, the administration portal creates an HTML iframe element that is used to load its host page. The plug-in host page is necessary to begin the plug-in bootstrap process, which (the bootstrap process) is used to evaluate the plug-in code in the context of the plug-in's iframe element. User interface plug-in infrastructure supports serving plug-in resource files (such as the plug-in host page) from the local file system. The plug-in host page is loaded into the iframe element and the plug-in code is evaluated. After the plug-in code is evaluated, the plug-in communicates with the administration portal by means of the plug-in API.

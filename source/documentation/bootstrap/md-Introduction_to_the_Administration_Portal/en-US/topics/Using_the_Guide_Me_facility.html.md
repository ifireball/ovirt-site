# Using the Guide Me Facility

When setting up resources such as data centers and clusters, a number of tasks must be completed in sequence. The context-sensitive **Guide Me** window prompts for actions that are appropriate to the resource being configured. The **Guide Me** window can be accessed at any time by clicking the **Guide Me** button on the resource toolbar.

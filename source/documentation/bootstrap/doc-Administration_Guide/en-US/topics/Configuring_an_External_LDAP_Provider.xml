	<title>Configuring an External LDAP Provider (Interactive Setup)</title>
	<para>The <filename>ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap</filename> extension allows users to customize their external directory setup easily. The <filename>ovirt-engine-extension-aaa-ldap</filename> extension supports many different LDAP server types, and an interactive setup script is provided to assist you with the setup for most LDAP types.</para>
	<para>If the LDAP server type is not listed in the interactive setup script, or you want to do more customization, you can manually edit the configuration files. See <xref linkend="Configuring_an_External_LDAP_Provider_ManualMethod"/> for more information.</para>

                  Specify a profile name. The profile name is visible to users on the login page. This example uses <literal>redhat.com</literal>. 
                 <note>
                  <para>To rename the profile after the domain has been configured, edit the <literal>ovirt.engine.aaa.authn.profile.name</literal> attribute in the <filename>/etc/ovirt-engine/extensions.d/<replaceable>redhat.com</replaceable>-authn.properties</filename> file. Restart the engine service for the changes to take effect.</para>

                  Select an LDAP type by entering the corresponding number. If you are not sure which schema your LDAP server is, select the standard schema of your LDAP server type. For Active Directory, follow the procedure at <xref linkend="Attaching_an_Active_Directory"/>.

                </para>
		<screen>It is highly recommended to use DNS resolution for LDAP server.
If for some reason you intend to use hosts or plain address disable DNS usage.
Use DNS (Yes, No) [Yes]: </screen>

               <step>
                <para>

                <screen>1 - Single server
2 - DNS domain LDAP SRV record
3 - Round-robin between multiple hosts
4 - Failover between multiple hosts
Please select:</screen>
     <stepalternatives>
  		<step>
  			<para>
  				For option 1, the DNS servers listed in <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> is used to resolve the IP address. Ensure the <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> file is updated with the correct DNS servers.
  			</para>
        <para>Enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the IP address of the LDAP server. You can use the <command>dig</command> command with the SRV record to find out the domain name. An SRV record takes the following format:  _<replaceable>service</replaceable>._<replaceable>protocol</replaceable>.<replaceable>domain name</replaceable>. For example: <command>dig _ldap._tcp.redhat.com SRV</command>.</para>
  		</step>
  		<step>
  			<para>
  				For option 2, enter the domain name of the DNS server. A DNS search is performed to look up the SRV records to find out the domain name of the LDAP server. 
  			</para>
        
  		</step>
  		<step>
  			<para>
  				For option 3, enter a space-separated list of LDAP servers. Use either the FQDN or IP address of the servers. This policy provides load-balancing between the LDAP servers. Queries are distributed among all LDAP servers according to the round-robin algorithm.
  			</para>
  		</step>
  		<step>
  			<para>
  				For option 4, enter a space-separated list of LDAP servers. Use either the FQDN or IP address of the servers. This policy defines the first LDAP server to be the default LDAP server to respond to queries. If the first server is not available, the query will go to the next LDAP server on the list.

   </step>
    <step>
		<para>
	         Select the secure connection method your LDAP server supports and specify the method to obtain a PEM-encoded CA certificate. The file option allows you to provide the full path to the certificate. The URL option allows you to specify a URL to the certificate. Use the inline option to paste the content of the certificate in the terminal. The system option allows you to specify the default location for all CA files. If the insecure mode is selected, the connection is still encrypted using TLS but certificate validation is skipped.
		</para>
		<screen>NOTE:
It is highly recommended to use secure protocol to access the LDAP server.
Protocol startTLS is the standard recommended method to do so.
Only in cases in which the startTLS is not supported, fallback to non standard ldaps protocol.
Use plain for test environments only.
Please select protocol to use (startTLS, ldaps, plain) [startTLS]: <replaceable>startTLS</replaceable>
Please select method to obtain PEM encoded CA certificate (File, URL, Inline, System, Insecure): <replaceable>File</replaceable>
Please enter the password:</screen>
<note>
 <para>LDAPS stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Over Secure Socket Links. For SSL connections, select the <literal>ldaps</literal> option.</para>
 <para>For more information on creating a PEM-encoded CA certificate, see <xref linkend="Setting_Up_SSL_or_TLS_Connections_between_the_Manager_and_an_LDAP_Server"/>.</para>

                     Test the search and login function to ensure the your LDAP server is connected to your Red Hat Virtualization environment properly. For the login query, enter the account name and password. For the search query, select <literal>Principal</literal> for user accounts, and select <literal>Group</literal> for group accounts. Enter <literal>Yes</literal> to <literal>Resolve Groups</literal> if you want the group account information for the user account to be returned. Select <literal>Done</literal> to complete the setup. Three configuration files are created and displayed in the screen output.
                </para>
                <screen>NOTE:
It is highly recommended to test drive the configuration before applying it into engine.
Perform at least one Login sequence and one Search sequence.

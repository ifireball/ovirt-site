<note>
	<para>
		The export storage domain is deprecated. Storage data domains can be unattached from a data center and imported to another data center in the same environment, or in a different environment. Virtual machines, floating virtual disk images, and templates can then be uploaded from the imported storage domain to the attached data center. See <xref linkend="sect-Importing_Existing_Storage_Domains" /> for information on importing storage domains.

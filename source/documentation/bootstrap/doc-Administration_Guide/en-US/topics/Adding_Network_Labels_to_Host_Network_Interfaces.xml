	<title>Adding Network Labels to Host Network Interfaces</title>
	<para>
		Using network labels allows you to greatly simplify the administrative workload associated with assigning logical networks to host network interfaces.
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>
			Setting a label on a role network (for instance, a migration network or a display network) causes a mass deployment of that network on all hosts. Such mass additions of networks are achieved through the use of DHCP. This method of mass deployment was chosen over a method of typing in static addresses, because of the unscalable nature of the task of typing in many static IP addresses.

	<para>
		You have added a network label to a host network interface. Any newly created logical networks with the same label will be automatically assigned to all host network interfaces with that label. Also, removing a label from a logical network will automatically remove that logical network from all host network interfaces with that label.

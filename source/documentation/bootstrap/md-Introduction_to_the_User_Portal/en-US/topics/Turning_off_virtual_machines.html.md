# Turning Off a Virtual Machine from the User Portal

If you attempt to turn off a virtual machine from the User Portal, it may freeze with a status of **Powering Down**, indicating that it has not completely shut down.

**Important:** To minimize the risk of data loss, log off from a virtual machine before turning it off.

**Turning Off a Virtual Machine from the User Portal**

1. Log out of the guest operating system.

2. If you were using your virtual machine in full screen mode, press **Shift** + **F11** to exit full screen mode, and close the virtual machine's console window. You are now returned to the User Portal.

    To turn off the virtual machine, click the ![](images/4647.png) button. The Stop symbol appears next to the name of the virtual machine when it has been turned off.

**Note:** You can also turn off virtual machines gracefully using the native method from within the virtual machine itself. For example, in Windows virtual machines you can click **Start** > **Shut Down**, and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machines you can click **System** > **Shut Down**.

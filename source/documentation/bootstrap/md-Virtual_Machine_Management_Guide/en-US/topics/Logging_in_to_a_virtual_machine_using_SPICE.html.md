# Opening a Console to a Virtual Machine

Use Remote Viewer to connect to a virtual machine.

**Connecting to Virtual Machines**

1. Install Remote Viewer if it is not already installed. See [Installing Console Components](sect-Installing_Console_Components).

2. Click the **Virtual Machines** tab and select a virtual machine.

3. Click the console button or right-click the virtual machine and select **Console**.

    * If the connection protocol is set to SPICE, a console window will automatically open for the virtual machine.

    * If the connection protocol is set to VNC, a `console.vv` file will be downloaded. Click on the file and a console window will automatically open for the virtual machine.

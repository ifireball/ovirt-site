		Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 introduces an upgraded version of the Red Hat Enterprise<!--still here on purpose, pls do not remove--> Virtualization Hypervisor. While the previous RHEV-H was a closed system with a basic text user interface for installation and configuration, Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH) can be updated via <command>yum</command> and uses an <application>Anaconda</application> installation interface based on the one used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts. <!--This para can be deleted in RHV 4.1, as it's just here to avoid confusion about RHEV-H-->

	<title>Setting Virtual Machine Custom Properties</title>
	<para>
		Once custom properties are defined in the Red Hat Virtualization Manager, you can begin setting them on virtual machines. Custom properties are set on the <guilabel>Custom Properties</guilabel> tab of the <guilabel>New Virtual Machine</guilabel> and <guilabel>Edit Virtual Machine</guilabel> windows in the Administration Portal.
	</para>
	<para>
		You can also set custom properties from the <guilabel>Run Virtual Machine(s)</guilabel> dialog box. Custom properties set from the <guilabel>Run Virtual Machine(s)</guilabel> dialog box will only apply to the virtual machine until it is next shutdown.
	</para>
	<para>
		The <guilabel>Custom Properties</guilabel> tab provides a facility for you to select from the list of defined custom properties. Once you select a custom property key an additional field will display allowing you to enter a value for that key. Add additional key/value pairs by clicking the <guilabel>+</guilabel> button and remove them by clicking the <guilabel>-</guilabel> button.

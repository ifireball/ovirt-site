	<title>Overview of Configuring Data Warehouse</title>
	<para>
		The Red Hat Virtualization Manager includes a comprehensive management history database, which can be utilized by any application to extract a range of information at the data center, cluster, and host levels. Installing Data Warehouse creates the <literal>ovirt_engine_history</literal> database, to which the Manager is configured to log information for reporting purposes. The Data Warehouse component is optional.

	<para>
		It is recommended that you set the system time zone for all machines in your Data Warehouse deployment to <acronym>UTC</acronym>. This ensures that data collection is not interrupted by variations in your local time zone: for example, a change from summer time to winter time.

	<para>
		To calculate an estimate of the space and resources the <literal>ovirt_engine_history</literal> database will use, use the <ulink url="https://access.redhat.com/labs/rhevmhdsc/">RHEV Manager History Database Size Calculator</ulink> tool. The estimate is based on the number of entities and the length of time you have chosen to retain the history records.

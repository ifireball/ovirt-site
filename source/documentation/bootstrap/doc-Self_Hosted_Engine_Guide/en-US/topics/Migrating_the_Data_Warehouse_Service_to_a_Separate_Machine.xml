	<title>Migrating the Data Warehouse Service to a Separate Machine</title>
	<para>
		Migrate a Data Warehouse service that was installed and configured on the Red Hat Virtualization Manager to a dedicated host machine. Hosting the Data Warehouse service on a separate machine helps to reduce the load on the Manager machine. Note that this procedure migrates the Data Warehouse service only; to migrate the Data Warehouse database (also known as the <literal>ovirt_engine_history</literal> database) prior to migrating the Data Warehouse service, see <xref linkend="Migrating_the_Data_Warehouse_Database_to_a_Separate_Machine" />.
	</para>
	<para>
		Installing this scenario involves four key steps:

		<title>Step 2: Stopping the Data Warehouse Service on the Manager Machine</title>
		<step>
			<para>
				Stop the Data Warehouse service:
			</para>
			<screen># systemctl stop ovirt-engine-dwhd.service</screen>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				If the <literal>ovirt_engine_history</literal> database, the Manager database, or both are hosted on the Manager machine and were configured by a previous version (Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.4 or prior) that was then upgraded, you must allow the new Data Warehouse machine to access them. Edit the <filename>/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf</filename> file and modify the <literal>listen_addresses</literal> line so that it matches the following:
			</para>
			<screen>listen_addresses = '*'</screen>
			<para>
				If the line does not exist or has been commented out, add it manually.
			</para>
			<para>
				If one or both databases are hosted on a remote machine, you must manually grant access by editing the <filename>postgres.conf</filename> file on each machine, and adding the <literal>listen_addresses</literal> line, as above. If both databases are hosted on the Manager machine and were configured during a clean setup of Red Hat Virtualization Manager, access is granted by default.
			</para>
		</step>

			<para>
				Restart the postgresql service:

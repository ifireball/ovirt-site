	<title>Creating a Virtual Machine Based on a Template</title>
	<para>
		Create virtual machines based on templates. This allows you to create virtual machines that are pre-configured with an operating system, network interfaces, applications and other resources.
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>
			Virtual machines created based on a template depend on that template. This means that you cannot remove that template from the Manager if there is a virtual machine that was created based on that template. However, you can clone a virtual machine from a template to remove the dependency on that template.

			<para>
				Select a template from the <guilabel>Based on Template</guilabel> list.

		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Enter a <guilabel>Name</guilabel>, <guilabel>Description</guilabel>, and any <guilabel>Comments</guilabel>, and accept the default values inherited from the template in the rest of the fields. You can change them if needed.

		<step>
			<para>
				Select the disk provisioning policy from the <guilabel>Allocation Policy</guilabel> list. This policy affects the speed of the clone operation and the amount of disk space the new virtual machine initially requires.

				<listitem>
					<para>
						Selecting <guilabel>Thin Provision</guilabel> results in a faster clone operation and provides optimized usage of storage capacity. Disk space is allocated only as it is required. This is the default selection.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Selecting <guilabel>Preallocated</guilabel> results in a slower clone operation and provides optimized virtual machine read and write operations. All disk space requested in the template is allocated at the time of the clone operation.
					</para>

			<para>
				Use the <guilabel>Target</guilabel> list to select the storage domain on which the virtual machine's virtual disk will be stored.

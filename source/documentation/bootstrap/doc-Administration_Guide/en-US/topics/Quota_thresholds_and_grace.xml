	<para>
		If a quota is set to 100 GB with 20% Grace, then consumers are blocked from using storage after they use 120 GB of storage. If the same quota has a Threshold set at 70%, then consumers receive a warning when they exceed 70 GB of storage consumption (but they remain able to consume storage until they reach 120 GB of storage consumption.) Both "Threshold" and "Grace" are set relative to the quota. "Threshold" may be thought of as the "soft limit", and exceeding it generates a warning. "Grace" may be thought of as the "hard limit", and exceeding it makes it impossible to consume any more storage resources.

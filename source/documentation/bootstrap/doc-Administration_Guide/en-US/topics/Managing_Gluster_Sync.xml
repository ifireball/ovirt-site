	<title>Managing Gluster Sync</title>
	<para>
		The Gluster Sync feature periodically fetches the latest cluster configuration from GlusterFS and syncs the same with the engine DB. This process can be performed through the Manager. When a cluster is selected, the user is provided with the option to import hosts or detach existing hosts from the selected cluster. You can perform Gluster Sync if there is a host in the cluster.

If the addition or removal of a host is detected, an action item is shown in the <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab for the cluster, where you can either to choose to <guilabel>Import</guilabel> the host into or <guilabel>Detach</guilabel> the host from the cluster.

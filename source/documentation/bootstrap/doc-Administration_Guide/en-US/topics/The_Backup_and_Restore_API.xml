	<para>
		The backup and restore <acronym>API</acronym> is a collection of functions that allows you to perform full or file-level backup and restoration of virtual machines. The <acronym>API</acronym> combines several components of Red Hat Virtualization, such as live snapshots and the <acronym>REST</acronym> <acronym>API</acronym>, to create and work with temporary volumes that can be attached to a virtual machine containing backup software provided by an independent software provider.

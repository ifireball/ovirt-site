	<title>Using Tags to Customize Interactions with Red Hat Virtualization</title>
	<para>
		After your Red Hat Virtualization platform is set up and configured to your requirements, you can customize the way you work with it using tags. <!-- The key advantage to using tags is the ability to search for hosts or virtual machines according to predefined user tags, and
filter the display according to specific tags.--> Tags provide one key advantage to system administrators: they allow system resources to be arranged into groups or categories. This is useful when many objects exist in the virtualization environment and the administrator would like to concentrate on a specific set of them.
	</para>
	<para>
		This section describes how to create and edit tags, assign them to hosts or virtual machines and search using the tags as criteria. Tags can be arranged in a hierarchy that matches a structure, to fit the needs of the enterprise.

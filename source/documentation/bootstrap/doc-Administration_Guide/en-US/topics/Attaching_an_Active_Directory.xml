		<para>
	    Select the secure connection method your LDAP server supports and specify the method to obtain a PEM-encoded CA certificate. The file option allows you to provide the full path to the certificate. The URL option allows you to specify a URL to the certificate. Use the inline option to paste the content of the certificate in the terminal. The system option allows you to specify the location for all CA files. The insecure option allows you to use startTLS in insecure mode.
		</para>
		<screen>NOTE:
It is highly recommended to use secure protocol to access the LDAP server.
Protocol startTLS is the standard recommended method to do so.
Only in cases in which the startTLS is not supported, fallback to non standard ldaps protocol.
Use plain for test environments only.
Please select protocol to use (startTLS, ldaps, plain) [startTLS]: <replaceable>startTLS</replaceable>
Please select method to obtain PEM encoded CA certificate (File, URL, Inline, System, Insecure): <replaceable>File</replaceable>
Please enter the password:</screen>
<note>
 <para>LDAPS stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Over Secure Socket Links. For SSL connections, select the <literal>ldaps</literal> option.</para>
 <para>For more information on creating a PEM-encoded CA certificate, see <xref linkend="Setting_Up_SSL_or_TLS_Connections_between_the_Manager_and_an_LDAP_Server"/>.</para>

            <step>
               <para>Enter the search user distinguished name (DN). The user must have permissions to browse all users and groups on the directory server. The search user must be of LDAP annotation. If anonymous search is allowed, press <keycap>Enter</keycap> without any input.</para>
                <screen>Enter search user DN (empty for anonymous): <replaceable>uid=user1,ou=Users,dc=test,dc=redhat,dc=com</replaceable>
Enter search user password:</screen>

                <step>
                <para>
                    Test the search and login function to ensure your LDAP server is connected to your Red Hat Virtualization environment properly. For the login query, enter the account name and password. For the search query, select <literal>Principal</literal> for user accounts, and select <literal>Group</literal> for group accounts. Enter <literal>Yes</literal> to <literal>Resolve Groups</literal> if you want the group account information for the user account to be returned. Select <literal>Done</literal> to complete the setup. Three configuration files are created and displayed in the screen output.
                </para>
                <screen>NOTE:
It is highly recommended to test drive the configuration before applying it into engine.
Perform at least one Login sequence and one Search sequence.
Select test sequence to execute (Done, Abort, Login, Search) [Abort]: Login
Enter search user name: <replaceable>testuser1</replaceable>
Enter search user password:

	<title>The Engine Configuration Tool</title>
	<para>
		The engine configuration tool is a command-line utility for configuring global settings for your Red Hat Virtualization environment. The tool interacts with a list of key-value mappings that are stored in the engine database, and allows you to retrieve and set the value of individual keys, and retrieve a list of all available configuration keys and values. Furthermore, different values can be stored for each configuration level in your Red Hat Virtualization environment.
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>
			Neither the Red Hat Virtualization Manager nor Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform need to be running to retrieve or set the value of a configuration key. Because the configuration key value-key mappings are stored in the engine database, they can be updated while the <literal>postgresql</literal> service is running. Changes are then applied when the <literal>ovirt-engine</literal> service is restarted.

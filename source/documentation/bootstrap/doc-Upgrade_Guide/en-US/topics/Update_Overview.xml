		The command used to perform the upgrade itself is engine-setup, which provides an interactive interface. While the upgrade is in progress, virtualization hosts and the virtual machines running on those virtualization hosts continue to operate independently. When the upgrade is complete, you can then upgrade your hosts to the latest versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Red Hat Virtualization Host.

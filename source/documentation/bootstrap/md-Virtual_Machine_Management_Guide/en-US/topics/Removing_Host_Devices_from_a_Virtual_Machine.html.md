# Removing Host Devices from a Virtual Machine

Remove a host device from a virtual machine to which it has been directly attached using the details pane of the virtual machine.

If you are removing all host devices directly attached to the virtual machine in order to add devices from a different host, you can instead add the devices from the desired host, which will automatically remove all of the devices already attached to the virtual machine.

**Removing a Host Device from a Virtual Machine**

1. Select the virtual machine and click the **Host Devices** tab in the details pane to list the host devices attached to the virtual machine.

2. Select the host device to detach from the virtual machine, or hold **Ctrl** to select multiple devices, and click **Remove device** to open the **Remove Host Device(s)** window.

3. Click **OK** to confirm and detach these devices from the virtual machine.
